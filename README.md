    > Quick Question:
    - How does a recipient phone number look like?

    > Quick Answer:
    - A recipient phone number is the international phone number of the recipient without the '+' prefix.
    - For example, where a Kenyan phone number is '+123456789' we would send the message to a recipientPhone 123456789.
    - For a phone number +123456789 we would send the message to a recipientPhone 12345678888.
    - For an US phone number +1 555-555-5555 we would send the message to a recipientPhone 5555555555.

let urlOfImage = result.data.qr_image_url;
```

#### Parse incoming messages:

```js
// req.body is the body of the request which ping the webhook. Invalid payloads will throw an error, and you should respond with HTTP status 5** or 4**, not 200.
// remember to respond with HTTP 200 status at the end of a succesful inbound request.
let data = conn.parseMessage(req.body);
/*
data.isMessage will be true if it is a message from a customer, it will be false otherwise.
data.isNotificationMessage will be true if it is a notification from a Meta(e.g a message delivery/read status notification), it will be false otherwise.
data will throw an error if the body of the webhook request is not valid or not from Meta.
